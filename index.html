The most recent site listed was Dholavira, in 2021. At different times, two sites were listed as endangered: the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary was listed between 1992 and 2011 due to poaching and activities of the Bodo militias, and the monuments at Hampi were listed between 1999 and 2006 due to risks from increased traffic and new constructions in surroundings. One site is transnational, The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier is shared with six other countries. In addition, India has 49 sites on its tentative list.
